=== elasticsearch node_stats MetricSet

This is the node_stats metricset of the module elasticsearch. It interrogates
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/cluster-nodes-stats.html[Cluster API endpoint] of
Elasticsearch to get the cluster nodes statistics. The data received is only for the local node so this Metricbeat has
to be run on each Elasticsearch node.
